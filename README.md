# openapi-dry-schema-generator

ðŸ›  This repository is WIP.
Generate dry-schema(ruby) from openapi spec file

## Summary

We want to output [dry-schema](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-schema) from the OpenAPI definition file.
It would be great if we could define the schema using only OpenAPI definition files.ðŸš€
Ruby API validation can be left to the OpenAPI definition.

## Status

ðŸ›  WIP!!
Only get request parameters are supported. (And that's the minimum!)
The implementation is also dirty.
Much work still needs to be done!
