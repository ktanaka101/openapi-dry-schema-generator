# openapi-dry-schema-generator

ðŸ›  This repository is WIP.
Generate dry-schema(ruby) from openapi spec file

## Summary

We want to output [dry-schema](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-schema) from the OpenAPI definition file.
I want to be able to delegate the validation of the API to be implemented in Ruby to the OpenAPI definition ðŸš€.

## Status

ðŸ›  WIP!!
Only get request parameters are supported. (And that's the minimum!)
The implementation is also dirty.
Much work still needs to be done!

The ultimate goal is to

- Provided as an executable file. (single binary, of course)
- Supports all definitions involving OpenAPI validation.
- Generate a ruby code within 1 second.
